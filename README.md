## Performance

Consumes minimal resources:

  * Uses a Manifest V3 short-lived light-weight [service worker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers/lifecycle#idle-shutdown) that only responds to narrow events.
  * Does not collect analytics.

## Third Party Notices

Icon is "[versions](https://octicons.github.com/icon/versions/)" from GitHub's [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/), rasterized with http://fa2png.io/r/octicons/versions/.
